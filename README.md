# RealEstateDeFi

Blockchains are positioned to be the next technological advancement in real estate investment. The potential for digitizing real estate assests means that ownership of these assets can be fracionalized through ownership of tokens.

Suppose a seller has a property title wrapped in a unique LLC and would like to sell fractionalized shares of the LLC to Ethereum investors. These investors would then have the rights to collect income on the property.

To make this transaction on the ERC 721 Network, the seller can use this application to convert their property into tokens and process the sale of them. 

---

## Purpose

This application is a smart contract Ethereum transaction tool which allows a real estate seller to tokenize and crowd sell properties.
 
 ---
 ## Installation Guide


To run the app from a local computer, clone repo. From the Terminal, activate conda envirnoment; change directory to StarterFile folder,
and type `streamlit run appNew.py`. This will launch a web browser with a local URL such as http://localhost:8501. *Note that you will need to install some libraries/dependencies if you do not already have them.* 

---
## Approach

1. Register the NFT with picture and appraisal value
 
2. Mint tokens in a cap that is equal to appraisal value in USD

3. Crowd sale
 
4. Deployer contract which deploys the NFT, tokens, and crowd sale

5. User interface in Streamlit
